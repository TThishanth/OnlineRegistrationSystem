## Laravel Online Registration System

Laravel Version
  - 7

Database
  - MySQL/phpMyAdmin

I done mini project related to online registration system for the students of Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka.

Working forms for users
  - Academic Year Registration Form
  - Hostel Registration Form
  - Repeat Exam Application Submissions Form

These all three forms are created based on the original forms of Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka. This application specifically saves the time exceptionally spent for the paper work of Administrator, Head of the Dept., Coordinator, Dean, Boys hostel Warden, Girls hostel Warden and the students. Only already signed up students (by Administrator) can submit forms. They can reset their password once they logged in. Administrators can Approve / Un-approve / Delete Submissions. Admin panel dashboard chart shows counts of new submissions of each forms to administrators.

Each submissions has separate administrators, Other administrators canâ€™t access that specific submission. For an example only boys hostel warden can access boys hostel registration submissions. Administrators can use search bar to identify specific user / submission. There is a common admin called Administrator, Only he can create both admins and students accounts. And also only he can view, edit and delete user accounts. This online system will reduce the work of students and administrators.
